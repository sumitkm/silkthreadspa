    <h2>The 'Greeter' Sample</h2>
    <p>
        'Greeter' is a simple component that takes in one parameter that's the name of the person to greet.
        In this sample, the 'Samples' page view model has an array called guests with three names - Sumit, Optimus and Bumblebee.
        This samples page, loops through the guests array and assigns one name to one greeter component in a standard ko foreach loop.
    </p>
